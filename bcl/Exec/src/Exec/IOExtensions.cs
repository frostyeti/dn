    /// Converts a string to SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE by inserting underscores between words and converting all characters to uppercase. It treats hyphens, spaces, and underscores as word separators and ignores non-alphanumeric characters. Consecutive uppercase letters are considered part of the same word unless followed by a lowercase letter, in which case an underscore is inserted before the uppercase letter. This method is useful for converting identifiers to a common constant naming convention.
